# Album Cover Match Game
Game is very simple, match the Album Cover to its corresponding Song
It's a fun game to play because even if we have heard the song before we
may not remember the album to which it belongs. Concept was created by
Bob Tabor(http://www.bobtabor.com/).
# Warning
App may not run because you have to set the Package Logo. I have a problem in setting the Package Logo, So if you've also experienced any problem in setting the package logo just create a new blank UWP app and copy all the nessory code from this and check Music Library under Capabilities in Package.appxmanifest file.
If you know what is the problem contact me @_Vijay_Nirmal_
